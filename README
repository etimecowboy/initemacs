* Introduction

This is my Emacs configuration with various collected lisps.

* Installation

1. Clone the repository to ".emacs.d/" in your HOME directory.
2. Un-compress the `cedet.zip' in the "/lisps" folder.
3. Enter the "/lisp/cedet" folder, and run
     "Emacs -nw -Q -l cedet-build.el -f cedet-build"
   in the terminal to install the cedet package.
4. Run Emacs, you will get Errors, but don't afraid of it.
5. "M-x xy/emacs-build" serveral times in the Emacs that you 
   just opened.
6. Restart Emacs.

* Maintain

After installation, you might want to change the configuration
files in "/my-lisps". Just do it and save the files.

** In Windows

You have to delete the `/my-lisps/init/xy-rcroot-env.elc'. 
after you modify the `/my-lisps/init/xy-rcroot-env.el', then
restart Emacs.

** In Linux

Just restart Emacs.

* Change local lisp packages

After you update/delete/modify the local lisp packages, just
change the corresponding configuration files and run 
"M-x xy/emacs-build" in the Emacs program to activate the new 
lisps.
