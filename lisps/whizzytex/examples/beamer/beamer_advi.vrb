\frametitle {Fragile (with no argument)}
\begin{itemize}

\item <1->
This frame works well written as
 \begin{verbatim}
    \begin{frame}[fragile]
    \frametitle{Fragile (with no argument)}
    ...
\end{verbatim}
\item <2->
But it would brake if written as
 \begin{verbatim}
    \begin{frame}[fragile]{Fragile (with no argument)}
    ...
\end{verbatim}
This seems to be a problem with beamer, independant of whizzytex.
\end{itemize}
