This directory contains an example of making whizzytexing with mlpost 
figures.

The figures can be inlined in the latex source file inside a toplevel 
environment (i.e. starting at column 0). 

     \begin{mlpost}{figname}
     <mlpost code>
     \end{mlpost}

The file main be whizzytex and the <mlpost code> may be edited,
errors produced during the compilation of the mlpost file by ocaml
are sent to whizzytex that puts an overlay on the error.

When the compilation succeeds a metapost image
"master:figname.mps" for each image "figname" (where "master" is the master
latex source file). 

The figures are recompiled lazily when their context or their
body have (lexically) changed. A cache of md5 of source code is kept in 
master.cache read by metapostfrom.

Since figures are display by advi, metapostfrom also creates 
postscript files "fff.font" for each font "fff" that is used by 
a figure figname. These fonts are listed in a file "master:figname.fonts"
which loads the fonts as if they were ps headers. This way, the fonts are
shaped between pages and slices and are automatically relaoaded when gs is
restarted.
